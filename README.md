# Team 59[StackUnderFlow] - Code For Good Hackathon 2022

## Problem Statement
* The current process of tracking the progress of various programs executed by the NGO - Bangalore Food Bank is manual, hence unorganized and difficult to track. 
* A dedicated portal is required to enable the NGOs to input the progress on a monthly basis.
* For the purpose of impact monitoring, data visualization is required for the administrator to visualize the progress in any particular task at a given time.
* Once the data is uploaded, validation of the NGOs should be done by email.

## Proposed Solution
* Manage data in an organized manner.
* User-friendly portal to filter and visualize the program specific progress of the NGOs.
* Visualize progress achieved in any particular task at any given time.
* Generate reports based on KPIs.
* Pre recorded voice mail is sent for validation, once the NGO gets enrolled.
