# Team 59 - CFG 2022

## Problem Statement
* The current process of tracking the progress of various programs executed by BFB is manual, hence unorganized and difficult to track 
* A dedicated portal is required to enable the NGOs to input the progress on a monthly basis.
* For the purpose of impact monitoring, data visualization is required for the administrator to visualize the progress in any particular task at a given time
* Validation of the NGOs

## Proposed Solution
* Manage data in an organized manner.
* User-friendly portal to filter and visualize the program specific progress of the NGOs.
* Visualize progress achieved in any particular task at any given time.
* Generate reports based on KPIs.
* Pre recorded voice mail is send once the NGO gets enrolled.
